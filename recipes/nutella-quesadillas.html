    <p>These are so simple…I didn’t want them on my blog. BUT! My son insisted they go up. Because they’re his favourite snack.</p>
    <p><em>Okay. So they’re my favourite snack passed down to him. That counts, right?</em></p>
    <p>It’s kind of a crime to post something with only two ingredients and possibly the quickest cooking time ever.</p>
    <p>All you have to do? Is spread the Nutella on some flour tortillas.</p>
    <p>Then fry them up in a nonstick pan until they’re warm and golden on the outside….and gooey with melted Nutella on the inside.</p>
    <p>Dust with a tiny amount of icing sugar for extra I.don’t.know.what.because.they.don’t.need.it.but.he.insisted.</p>
    <p>You can add sliced bananas, strawberries, blueberries, or even some sweet cheese slices. But for today only…he just wanted Nutella.</p>
    <p>And serve with whatever your heart desires.</p>
    <p>And he just wanted to hold them up for you guys…like this…with trembling and excited little 6 year old hands after patiently waiting on the side lines just watching me work. Or, watching the Nutella ooze out of the tortillas, busting to eat one.</p>
